# Shift-reduce conflicts

## Conflicts

1. State 1 conflicts: 1 shift/reduce
2. State 28 conflicts: 1 shift/reduce
3. State 31 conflicts: 1 shift/reduce

## Conflict1

### detail

```
State 1

    8 exp: ID . LPAREN args RPAREN
   21    | ID . LBRACE recorditems RBRACE
   22    | ID . LBRACK exp RBRACK OF exp
   62 lvalue: ID .
   65       | ID . LBRACK exp RBRACK

    LPAREN  shift, and go to state 15
    LBRACK  shift, and go to state 16
    LBRACE  shift, and go to state 17

    LBRACK    [reduce using rule 62 (lvalue)]
    $default  reduce using rule 62 (lvalue)
```

### reason

The conflict happens when meets LBRACK, and it will shift until State 86 which may meet OF. When State 86 meets OF, it chooses to shift, which satisfies our requirement, so it is right.

## Conflict2

### detail

```
State 28

   49 tydecs: tydec .
   50       | tydec . tydecs

    TYPE  shift, and go to state 27

    TYPE      [reduce using rule 49 (tydecs)]
    $default  reduce using rule 49 (tydecs)

    tydec   go to state 28
    tydecs  go to state 65
```

### reason

The conflict happens when meets tydec, it chooses to shift, which satisfies our requirement, so it is right.

## Conflict3

### detail

```
State 31

   55 fundecs: fundec .
   56        | fundec . fundecs

    FUNCTION  shift, and go to state 25

    FUNCTION  [reduce using rule 55 (fundecs)]
    $default  reduce using rule 55 (fundecs)

    fundec   go to state 31
    fundecs  go to state 66
```

### reason

The conflict happens when meets fundec, it chooses to shift, which satisfies our requirement, so it is right.
